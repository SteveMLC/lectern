# AI usage reimbursement audit

Generated 2026-08-10 17:39 UTC by `pnpm usage:report`. Do not edit by hand — regenerate instead.

Ledger digest: `3c737ec0bf8c46dd58dd963fe7147fad1efb0a7555b660cd8420329473138ab1` (6 entries). `pnpm usage:check` fails if this file no longer matches the ledger.

## The three numbers, kept separate

1. **Provider-reported tokens** — counters copied from local provider session logs.
2. **API-equivalent estimate — $173.91** — those tokens at pinned public list prices ([pricing.json](pricing.json)). A workload gauge, not a bill.
3. **Actual billed spend — $0.00 evidenced so far** — the number a reimbursement claim uses. 5 entries await subscription receipts.

The [brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rBHJtiNKHv4i43tdf2Rm0sDEYuIcajhmAPoBKR_Az-A/) allows a valid submission up to **$500** in token-cost reimbursement, including qualifying Codex Pro / Claude Max subscription usage, subject to proof and organizer review. The claim will be the receipt amounts, capped at $500 — never the API-equivalent gauge.

## Evidence inventory

One row per immutable ledger entry. The digest is the SHA-256 of the raw provider session log, which is retained privately and available to the organizer on request.

## How to audit this

1. `pnpm usage:check` — validates every entry against the schema, recomputes each cost from [pricing.json](pricing.json), rejects duplicate evidence, and confirms this report matches the ledger digest above.
2. `git log --follow usage/ledger.jsonl` — the ledger is append-only; history shows every addition in context.
3. Compare any entry's `sha256` against the raw session log we provide on request; the line count must match.
4. Check receipts against entries marked `pending_subscription_receipt` when the claim is filed.
